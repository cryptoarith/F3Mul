Improved Polynomial Multiplication Algorithms in Characteristic Three Fields and Applications on  NTRU Prime Decapsulation
This repository contains improved polynomial multiplication methods in characteristic three fields and their application on NTRU Prime Key Encapsulation Mechanism.
B1-Hybrid1 and B1-Hyrid2 uses Bernstein's 3-way approach whereas U1-Hybrid1 and U1-Hybrid2 uses our approach. We implement the proposed algorithms combining with 
the other known methods on Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-10510U architecture using C and obtain a 29.85% speedup for sntrup653 and a 35.52% speedup for sntrup761.
